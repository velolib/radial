### A simple and opinionated Minecraft radial menu.

</div>

## Overview

**Radial** is a streamlined utility mod that consolidates your commands and keybinds into a single, intuitive interface. Instead of memorizing dozens of complex macros, Radial allows you to trigger your most-used actions through a seamless radial menu.



## Features

* **Opinionated Design:** Built for speed and simplicity. Just your actions, where you need them.
* **Unified Actions:** Bind chat commands, chat messages, or existing keybinds to a single hotkey.
* **On-the-Fly Editing:** Customize your layout without leaving the game. Right-click any slot while the menu is open to change its icon, action, or name.
* **Deep Configuration:** Tweak the slot count, ring radius, and animation speeds via **ModMenu** and **YACL**, complete with a live preview.
* **Submenus:** Keep your workflow clean by organizing related actions into nested radial menus.

## Usage

1.  **Open:** Hold the radial key (Default: **R**) to bring up the menu.
2.  **Navigate:** Hover your cursor over the desired slot to highlight it.
3.  **Execute:** Click to trigger the action instantly.
4.  **Manage:** Right-click a slot to open the built-in editor, or use the config screen for layout adjustments.
